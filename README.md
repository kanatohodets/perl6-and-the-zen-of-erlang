# Perl 6 and the Zen of Erlang

A talk given at [The Perl Conference 2016, Orlando Fl](http://www.yapcna.org/yn2016/talk/6600). Perl conferences are wonderful, you should go to some!

You can watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73-XQEn6HfI

Material from my nodes while I was preparing can be found in notes.md.
Eventually I'll write this up as a blog, and will link it here for faster
consumption than watching a video. Until then, you can get the gist of it from
the notes.

Massive credit to the inspiration for this talk, Fred Herbert's [The Zen of Erlang](http://ferd.ca/the-zen-of-erlang.html). Strongly encourage checking out the original: it goes into far more detail than I do on many fronts, and is a generally excellent read.

The video has unreadable code demos, so the entire code I spoke about can be
found in `examples/perl6/sleepy-promises.p6` and `more-sleepy-promises.p6`.
